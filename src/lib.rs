//! A minimal and fast template engine.
//!
//! Ban is a template engine that compiles templates at runtime.
//! It supports the basic features you might expect, it's easy to use,
//! and it tries to provide good error messages.
//!
//! # Features
//! - Common logical expressions (`if`, `let`, and `for`).
//! - Output expressions with user-defined filters.
//!     - An optional standard library providing filters for common
//!     functionality like HTML escaping.
//! - Multiple strategies for template inheritance.
//!     - Block/extends - divide a template up into blocks that can be
//!     overridden by child templates.
//!     - Include - render another template at the specified location.
//!
//! ```text
//! ðŸ¦Š Note
//!
//! Ban is still in development and is not ready to be used.
//!
//! I only document features here that are actually implemented, but even then,
//! information may be incomplete until v1.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Create a new [`Engine`][`crate::Engine`] with [`default`][`crate::default`],
//! or if you want to use custom delimiters, create a `Syntax` with
//! [`Builder`][`crate::Builder`] first and use the [`new`][`crate::Engine::new`]
//! method instead.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let engine = ban::default();
//! ```
//!
//! The `Engine` type provides a place for you to register filters and store
//! other templates that you can use with the `include` expression.
//!
//! ## Compile
//!
//! Use the `Engine` to compile a [`Template`][`crate::Template`].
//!
//! ```rust
//! let engine = ban::default();
//! let template = engine.compile("hello (( name ))!");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Create a Store
//!
//! The template we just compiled has a single expression that wants to render something
//! called "name".
//!
//! To render this, we will need to supply a [`Store`][`crate::Store`] instance that contains
//! a value for that "name" key.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ban::Store;
//!
//! let mut store = Store::new();
//! store.insert_must("name", "taylor");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Render
//!
//! Now that we have a `Store` containing the data our `Template` wants
//! to use, we can tell the `Engine` to render it for us.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ban::Store;
//!
//! let engine = ban::default();
//! let template = engine.compile("hello, (( name ))!");
//!
//! let mut store = Store::new();
//! store.insert_must("name", "taylor");
//!
//! let result = engine.render(&template.unwrap(), &store);
//! assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), "hello, taylor!");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Working Without an Engine
//!
//! You don't have to create an `Engine` to compile and render, Ban exposes
//! [`compile`][`crate::compile()`] and [`render`][`crate::render()`] as a shortcut.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ban::{compile, render, Store};
//!
//! let template = compile("hello, (( name ))!");
//! let result = render(
//!     &template.unwrap(),
//!     &Store::new().with_must("name", "taylor")
//! );
//!
//! assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), "hello, taylor!");
//! ```
//!
//! However, because the `Engine` contains all of the `Filter` instances,
//! working this way means that you will not have the ability to use
//! custom filters.
//!
//! Another thing you might have noticed, the above example uses
//! [`with_must`][`Store::with_must`] to insert data instead of
//! [`insert_must`][`Store::insert_must`]. This method does the same thing,
//! but provides a more fluent interface.
//!
//! # Syntax
//!
//! Ban doesn't have a lot of complicated syntax to learn. It should be
//! familiar if you've used any other template engine.
//!
//! This section provides an overview of expressions, and the different
//! blocks you can use.
//!
//! ## Expressions
//!
//! Expressions let you render content from the `Store`, or literal values
//! such as strings and numbers. They look like this:
//!
//! ```html
//! (( name | to_lowercase | left 3 ))
//! ```
//!
//! You can use filters to transform content in expressions.
//!
//! The input for the first filter comes from the value on the far left.
//! It travels through each filter from left to right, and the output of
//! the final filter in the chain is what gets rendered.
//!
//! Filters may accept any number of arguments, or none. They may be named or anonymous.
//!
//! Named arguments look like this:
//!
//! ```html
//! (( name | tag name: "taylor", age: 25 ))
//! ```
//!
//! Anonymous arguments work the same way, but have no explicit name:
//!
//! ```html
//! (( name | tag "taylor", 25 ))
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`filter`][`crate::filter`] module for more information.
