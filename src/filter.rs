//! Declares the Filter trait and documents the creation and usage of filters.
//!
//! A filter is any type which implements the Filter trait seen below.
//! Filter instances may be assigned to an Engine with the [.add_filter()] method,
//! and will be available in any template which is rendered by that Engine instance.
//!
//! Given this expression:
//!
//! ```html
//! (( name | prepend 1: "hello, " | append "!" | upper ))
//! ```
//!
//! The "name" value is not quoted, and so it is perceived to be an identifier
//! and not a literal. Upon rendering this expression, Ash will search the
//! Store for an entry with a key of "name" and use the value as the input
//! for the first filter in the chain.
//!
//! The vertical pipe "|" denotes that the following identifier is the name of
//! a filter. Ash will search for a filter with the name of "prepend" and execute
//! it with whatever "name" evaluated to as input.
//!
//! One argument for "prepend" is seen here, with a name of "1" and a value of
//! "hello, ". This is an example of a named argument, but anonymous arguments
//! are also supported.
//!
//! The next filter, "append", is using an anonymous argument.
//!
//! Anonymous arguments have no explicitly assigned name, but they do still
//! receive a name when Ash discovers them. For each anonymous argument in a
//! filter call, the name is equal to (n + 1) where n is the number of anonymous\
//! arguments which came before the argument.
//!
//! So, in the case of "append", the argument has a name of "1" and can be
//! retrieved inside of the filter like so:
//!
//! ```rs
//! args.get("1")
//! ```
