Ash is a minimal and fast template engine. It supports the basic features you might expect, and it's easy to use. It also tries to provide useful error messages when things break.

## Planned features

<ul>
  <li>Block expressions (for/if/let, etc)</li>
  <li>Variable expressions with user-defined filters</li>
  <li>Template inheritance</li> 
  <li>Other useful things built-in, such as HTML escaping.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<p>This is work-in-progress. Implemented features will be documented below.</p>
