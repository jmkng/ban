<!-- 
Example template that illustrates how an inheritance system might work. 

This is the child template, so the blocks here would be collected and carried
to the parent, in a loop, until the base template is found and executed.
-->
(* extends parent.html *)

<!-- 
Just one block.

We see that an extends block exists, so we search for the named parent.

When we parse the parent template, we will collect a series of blocks from them.
After this is done, we can check each block and see if any of them are named
identically to one of our blocks.

If we see one, we will change its Region information to be identical to our
blocks Region, so that when the template is rendered it gets the correct
data.

(* block content *)
    Hello, (( name ))

    (* for person in people *)
        (( person.name ))
    (* endfor *)

    (* if name == "taylor" *)
        Welcome back, Taylor.
    (* endfor *)

    (( name | prepend 1: "hello, " | append "!" | upper ))
(* endblock *)
