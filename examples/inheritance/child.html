<!-- 
Example template that demonstrates how "block" and "extends" are used. 

This is a child template because it begins with an "extends" expression. 
The blocks here are collected and carried to the parent. Assuming the parent
is not extended itself, the blocks will be executed there.

<!-- 
One block named "content" is found here.
