Example template that demonstrates how "block" and "extends" are used.

This is a parent template extended by "child.html". Blocks here will 
be overridden by any child with a matching block.

    When a block has content inside of it and the child template has no
    matching block, the content is executed as a "default" value.
    -->
    (* block content *)
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
    (* end *)
    <!--
    In this case, the child template has a matching "content" block, 
    so the block is replaced and "<h1>Hello!</h1>" is ignored.
